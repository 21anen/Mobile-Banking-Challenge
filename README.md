# Mobile-Banking-Challenge
With a team of 3, Anen Isaac, Godson Ntungi, Habiba Machela we practiced and implemented the Data science  life cycle within this project. Our final product is a predictive model deployed on streamlit that predicts whether a customer is using mobile banking or internet banking based on your response to the question.
